# MathTools

MathTools is a Wolfram Language package that provides the software infrastructure I use for creating typeset mathematical diagrams and equations, publishing to markdown, and working with various other tools.

It is the basis for the blog series https://math.tali.link as well as the older project https://quivergeometry.net.
